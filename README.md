HealthBuddy: A Multilingual AI Public Health ChatbotHealthBuddy is an intelligent, multilingual chatbot designed to provide accessible public health information via WhatsApp. This project was created to educate rural and semi-urban populations about common diseases, their symptoms, and prevention methods, breaking language barriers by offering real-time translation.The chatbot is built using the Rasa Open Source framework for conversational AI and connects to WhatsApp using the Twilio API.Core Featuresüåê Multilingual Support: Automatically detects the user's language, translates it to English for processing by the Rasa model, and translates the response back, supporting seamless conversations in multiple languages (e.g., Hindi, Odia, English).ü©∫ Symptom Checker: Users can describe their symptoms in natural language (e.g., "I have a fever and headache"). The bot analyzes the input and suggests potential matching diseases from its knowledge base.‚ùì Disease Q&A: Provides direct answers to questions about the symptoms and prevention methods for a wide range of common diseases.üß† Contextual Memory: The chatbot remembers the disease being discussed, allowing for natural follow-up questions (e.g., "how to prevent that?").üì± WhatsApp Integration: Fully integrated with WhatsApp through a Python Flask server and the Twilio API, making it highly accessible.üëÜ Interactive Buttons: After a diagnosis, the bot provides interactive buttons to guide the user to their next logical query, such as viewing symptoms or prevention tips.Technical StackConversational AI: Rasa Open SourceWhatsApp Integration: Twilio APIBackend & API Bridge: Python, FlaskReal-time Translation: googletrans libraryDevelopment Tunneling: ngrok for exposing local servers to the internet.Setup and InstallationFollow these steps to set up and run the project on your local machine.1. Clone the Repositorygit clone <your-repository-url>
cd <repository-folder>
2. Create a Python Virtual EnvironmentIt's highly recommended to use a virtual environment to manage project dependencies.python -m venv venv
# Activate the environment
# On Windows:
.\venv\Scripts\activate
# On macOS/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate
3. Install DependenciesInstall all the required Python libraries using the requirements.txt file.pip install -r requirements.txt
4. Set Up ngrokDownload and install ngrok.Create a free account to get your authtoken.Create a file named ngrok.yml and add your authtoken and tunnel configurations as described in the project.5. Configure TwilioSign up for a free Twilio account.Note your Account SID and Auth Token from the Twilio Console.Set up the Twilio Sandbox for WhatsApp and get your sandbox phone number.How to Run the ProjectTo run the full application, you need to have four separate terminal windows open, with the virtual environment activated in each.Step 1: Train the Rasa Model(Only required if you make changes to the .yml files in the data/ folder)rasa train
Step 2: Start the ServersRun these commands in their own dedicated terminals.Terminal 1: Rasa Action Serverrasa run actions
Terminal 2: Main Rasa Serverrasa run --enable-api
Terminal 3: ngrok Tunnelsngrok start --config ngrok.yml --all
This will provide you with two public URLs.Terminal 4: Twilio Bridge Serverpython twilio_bridge.py
Step 3: Connect the URLsCopy the rasa-server URL from ngrok and paste it into the RASA_WEBHOOK_URL variable in twilio_bridge.py.Copy the twilio-bridge URL from ngrok and paste it into your Twilio Sandbox settings.You can now send a message to your Twilio number on WhatsApp to start a conversation!Disclaimer: This chatbot is a proof-of-concept and is not a substitute for professional medical advice.
